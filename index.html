            <h4 class="tate">About andrew Tate</h4>
            <p>Emory Andrew Tate III (born 1 December 1986) is an American-British social media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. His controversial commentary has resulted in his expulsions from various social media platforms and concern that he promotes misogynist views to his audience.[3] As a divisive influencer,[4] Tate has amassed over 9 million followers on X;[5] and was the third-most "googled" person in 2023,[6] with most British adults aware of who he is.[7] He has been dubbed the "king of toxic masculinity",[8] as part of the manosphere;[9] is associated with far-right activists and ideologies,[10] and has previously self-described as a misogynist.[11] As of May 2024, Tate is facing three legal cases – two criminal and one civil – in Romania and the United Kingdom.[12]

                Tate first began to kickbox in 2005, winning several kickboxing titles in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2016, he appeared on the British reality series Big Brother, but was removed as he was the suspect in an open rape investigation in the United Kingdom. The investigation was later dropped, prior to again being suspected in 2024.[13] After his kickboxing career, Tate and his brother, Tristan, began operating a webcam model business, followed by selling online courses. With his audience from his courses, he became prominent as an internet celebrity promoting a hyper-macho view of masculinity.[14][15][16] Tate's courses include: Hustler's University, which gained 100,000 subscribers, later rebranded to The Real World; and the secretive War Room group, which has been accused by the BBC of coercing women into sex work, and teaching violence against women.[17] In August 2023, it was estimated that Tate's online ventures generated US$5 million in revenue per month.[18]</p>
